A small server that implements RFC 865 Quote of the day protocol.

If a TCP request is received via port 17 (if not otherwise specified) a random quote from the 
given text file is selected and send as a response. 

The code originates from a university assignment and is not yet fully functional in the way intended.
There are still bugs to iron out but the core functionality already works.
